For the web app : 

You need to have React installed, and node.js with node package manager (npm)  

For the api, you mainly need to have python fastapi and uvicorn installed  

```sh
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
```

For the machine learning file, you mainly need tensoflow, json, panda, numpy installed  

```sh
pip install tensorflow
pip install json
pip install panda
pip install numpy
```

It is possible to need other package (like pydantic), just follow your error to install which one you need

## || First step ||
Before to make everything, you have to install all packages.  
Once done, you have to load the api, then you can load the web app.  

## || Run API ||
Under the root folder (Ynov_B3_Data_BookStoryTelling) :  
For this part, you have to be under the Python folder :  ```cd Python```  
You have to make the command :  ``` uvicorn API:app --reload```   
Once done, you can use Postman (or other app you want) and load the following routes :    

- GET (Get all genres in app) : http://127.0.0.1:8000/genres
- GET (Get all languages in app) : http://127.0.0.1:8000/languages
- POST (make a research with data): http://127.0.0.1:8000/search
- POST (make a research with input field): http://127.0.0.1:8000/research

Data example Search : 
```sh
{
    "genres": ["FICTION"],
    "languages": ["EN"]
}
```

Data example Research : 
```sh
{
    "labels": "Harry Potter 3" 
}
```


## || Run Web App ||
Under the root folder (Ynov_B3_Data_BookStoryTelling) :  
For this part, you have to be under the web_app folder :  ```cd web_app```  
You have to make the command : ```npm run start```   

Don't forget to make the command ```npm install``` the first time you install this project.  
Just wait and the app will open under one of your browser.  

If everything goes well, you will see the Home Page of the app :
